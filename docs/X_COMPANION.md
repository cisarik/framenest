# FrameNest X meme browser companion

This document is the operator and user setup guide for the unpacked Manifest
V3 companion under `extension/`. It does not authorize publication, NUC
deployment, signed-in X probing, or a yt-dlp pin change.

## What it does

An authenticated FrameNest user can:

- hover (or keyboard-focus) a green **+** at the bottom-right of each image,
  video, or GIF in an eligible X post and click **Save to FrameNest** to open
  a Save popup (Title, Description, Search tags, Save). Save from X is an
  Edit-media subset: alt-first Title, tall tweet Description, existing-tag
  search, one Save, no category radios. The header close **X**, Escape, or a click
  outside cancel without a request and restore focus to that **+**. Save
  submits the post permalink and an optional caller-private alias (title,
  description, and selected existing tag keys); it omits `content_category` and
  does not send a per-asset media URL. First catalog seeds canonical title,
  description, and selected tags from that alias; later Save updates the alias
  only. Public JPEG and PNG photographs catalog;
  WebP and other still formats fail closed without transcoding. Overlay copy
  distinguishes saving, saved, already saved, partial, failed, catalog-removed,
  and unknown transport; failed Save keeps the plus glyph and a danger border,
  not an × and not generic success. Everyone sees a single right-aligned
  **Save**.
- click into the reply composer to reveal a floating **+** on the right of
  "Post your reply" (not inserted into the X input row), then open an in-page
  FrameNest search popup above that button;
- type `++` in that same reply composer (after start-of-field or whitespace,
  not inside `C++`) to open the picker and consume those two characters;
- type a search in that in-page picker (blank or cleared search lists no
  catalog hit and shows no preview chrome; on-screen arrows appear only after
  two or more hits), see the selected meme as one JPEG preview, and attach it
  with Enter or Attach onto the composer file input;
- open the toolbar side panel to use one merged title-bar companion history
  (`#review-history-toggle`, `#review-history`, `#review-history-list`) above
  the surviving hosted FrameNest iframe, with analyzed rows green and pending
  rows dark, and attach a Gallery item onto the bound X composer. In that hosted
  Gallery, open-original stays bottom-right and Attach sits top-left on the card
  image. Ordinary browser tabs keep open-original only. Gallery 📎 attaches
  after the reply composer is focused, and the shell reports Attached only when
  that composer file input accepted the bytes.

## Review history

The side panel has one merged title-bar history (`#review-history-toggle`,
`#review-history`, `#review-history-list`) above the surviving iframe. There is
no `#review-inbox` list. History starts collapsed on every panel load, is not
persisted, and expands directly under the title bar. Analyzed rows use
`review-history-button--analyzed` (accent green). Pending rows use
`review-history-button--pending` (dark). Clicking a row never removes it. A
pending overlay shows `No successful analysis yet.` and does not send an opened
mutation. An analyzed row still marks opened through the durable route; Review
Save retries opened before Apply when an earlier opened request failed, retains
selections and blocks Apply if that retry fails, and does not issue a second
opened mutation after success. Hover and keyboard focus alone do not mark a
row opened.

Save from X best-effort seeds `GET /api/canonical-tags?surface=x-companion-save`
with the fixed `x` / `𝕏` pair and prepends that exact pair once when the list
contains it. Bare tag GET does not seed. Apply preserves current canonical tags
and appends newly submitted mapped AI keys, re-enumerating from 0; overflow at
32 tags is HTTP 409 `COMPANION_REVIEW_TAG_LIMIT_CONFLICT`. Detail and Apply
responses expose `canonical.tag_sources` and retain whole-field
`field_sources.tags`.

The successful connection status is blank. Configuration guidance, framing and
request failures, `Cleared`, and `Attached` still use `#shell-status`. An
ordinary 403 or a complete-list failure hides history; 403 also disables and
collapses it. The toolbar badge remains the server `unopened_count` as
`1`…`99` / `99+`, never a rendered length or title; pending rows never increment
it. Alarm `framenest.review-inbox` runs every 1 minute. There is no
`notifications` permission or second counter. The hosted `#frame` stays mounted
and Attach survives. Ingest Save remains Title→Tags→Description→Save with no
radios or Analyze. Exactly four `companion_mutation` routes remain: X submit, X
retry, review opened, and review apply.

A second overlay opens local `ui/review.html` through
`chrome.runtime.getURL` plus `#media=<uuid>`. It is not web-accessible and is
not inside `#frame`. Ingest Save remains the frozen capture form (no category
radios).

GET inbox routes work with an empty origin allowlist. Mutations that carry the
extension Origin fail closed when the allowlist is empty. This document does
not authorize NUC deployment or enabling automatic analysis.

Save is a hover/focus overlay at the bottom-right of own media tiles, not an
action-row control. Click opens the Save popup instead of silently posting
`{ url }`. Text-only posts have no Save. Attach is shown when the
composer is focused, not on mouseover, and is not the side panel. The in-page
picker is compact quick attach with preview; it is not the full website.
Empty search shows no preview chrome; arrows appear after two or more hits;
typing `++` in the reply composer opens the picker and consumes the token.
After connect, the in-page picker has no Settings sheet; an empty origin tells
the user to connect FrameNest in the side panel. Settings persists the origin
with Save under the origin field. The title-bar control is Connect when
disconnected and Disconnect (existing Reset) when connected. Empty title-bar
Connect opens Settings. Save writes settings; Connect and Disconnect in the
title bar attach or clear the session. The toolbar opens
that shell, which iframes FrameNest only after the stored origin is granted.
If the iframe does not load, the shell reports that FrameNest did not load and
does not open a new tab. If the iframe loads without the companion host, the
library stays visible and the shell says this server cannot host companion
Attach yet. Per-asset Save targeting remains deferred.

Attach floats on the focused reply field; it is not inserted into the X input
row. Inline reply Attach is re-injected when X replaces the composer tree and the
previous button is no longer in the document. Save keeps a plus glyph when
the request fails; failure is the `title` / `aria-label` and a danger border,
not an ×.

The companion never clicks Post, never copies cookies or X credentials, and
never talks to FrameNest from a content script.

## Stable unpacked ID and private-key custody

The committed `extension/manifest.json` `key` field pins a development public
key. The derived unpacked extension origin is:

```text
chrome-extension://omiihmnlkmieaafaphohakcgmbggppap
```

The matching private key is local-only at `private/companion-extension.pem.key`
(gitignored via `/private/`). Do not commit, log, or copy that file into chat,
issues, or deployment artifacts. Rotating the key changes the extension ID and
requires an allowlist update.

## Server allowlist (inert until set)

Default `FRAMENEST_COMPANION_EXTENSION_ORIGINS` is empty. Four
`companion_mutation` routes may accept that exact `chrome-extension://` origin:
X submit, X retry, review opened, and review apply. GET inbox routes do not
require the allowlist in the same way; mutations that carry the extension Origin
fail closed when it is empty. Other browser mutations stay on the exact
Tailscale web origin. To enable the companion:

```text
FRAMENEST_COMPANION_EXTENSION_ORIGINS=["chrome-extension://omiihmnlkmieaafaphohakcgmbggppap"]
```

Rollback: remove the key or set it to `[]` and restart. No CORS is enabled.

## Load in Brave or Chromium

1. Open `brave://extensions` or `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer mode.
3. Load unpacked and select the repository `extension/` directory.
4. Confirm the ID is `omiihmnlkmieaafaphohakcgmbggppap`.
5. Open the toolbar side panel. On first run or after Disconnect, open Settings
   in the green title bar, enter the exact FrameNest HTTPS origin
   (`https://<node>.<tailnet>.ts.net`, no path), then click Save under the origin
   field and grant the host permission when prompted. After Save, Settings closes,
   the success status stays blank, the shell iframes that origin, and the
   title-bar control reads Disconnect. Save stays disabled until the origin
   differs from the stored value. Connect and Disconnect live in the title bar.
   The in-page Search memes picker has no Settings sheet.
6. Use Disconnect in the side-panel title bar to clear stored origin, in-flight
   claim ids, and the granted host permission. Settings then opens so reconnect
   stays in one place. Clearing the origin field does not Disconnect.

After using **Reload** for the unpacked extension, refresh already-open X tabs
and reopen the side panel before using Save or the picker. If an already-open X
tab or extension surface reaches the invalidated context first, FrameNest shows
`FrameNest was reloaded. Refresh X and reopen the side panel.`, closes partial
Save/picker hosts, and disables the affected controls. The notice is specific to
a missing runtime ID or the exact `Extension context invalidated` failure;
unrelated runtime failures keep their existing behavior.

Content scripts match only `https://x.com/*` and `https://twitter.com/*`. The
service worker has no X host permission.

## Residual gaps

- Live signed-in X DOM evidence is not part of repository acceptance.
- Independent INFOSEC R3 of the private status-bridge seam and CDN transport
  remains a later grant.
- Side-panel iframe framing against live Tailscale Serve or Brave Shields is
  a named residual until a later operator probe.
- A FrameNest origin that does not ship `companion_host.js` can still appear
  in the side panel; Gallery Attach requires that host script on the served
  web.
- Larger-than-32-MiB attach uses optional `chrome.downloads` with Save As;
  it still does not auto-post.
